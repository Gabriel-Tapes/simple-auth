<h1 align=center>Node Simple Auth</h1>

This is a simple web app to learn about authentication practices.
The app will have three pages:

1. Create account page
2. Login Page
3. A private page.

The api will have 3 post routes:

1. POST create user
    Create user in database and return user without password    

2. POST login
    Create a session in database and return a JWT Token

3. POST logout
    Delete session in database

The server and API will be made without any libs, database will be sqlite3 and front end will be made in vanilla js.
